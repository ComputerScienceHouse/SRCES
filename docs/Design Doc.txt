---Components---
	CenterRing
		A web interface to SRCES
		Shows the user the current state of each TicketBooth
		Allows the user to change the state (locked/unlocked) of any public TicketBooth
			Controls will be disabled if the TicketBooth is private
		*Automatically updates page to show the status information when it changes
		Connected to multiple LionTamers

	LionTamer
		A communication daemon for the TicketBooth
		Runs continuously on a host machine physically connected to a TicketBooth
		Connected to CenterRing via a network connection
		Listens for status updates from its TicketBooth
			Serial Connection
		Listens for messages from CenterRing (queries or commands)
			TCP/IP Connection
		Responds to queries and commands from CenterRing
		Looks up user's name when an invalid login is attempted and logs it to a file

	TicketBooth
		The physical access controller for each door
		Checks iButton IDs based off of an internal access list
		Can be sent into private mode
			Blocks all open requests
		Controls the locking mechanism on the door
		Can disable the 1-Wire bus if there is a short
	
--Protocols---
	HighWire
		Used to talk between all the components
		Can be sent over serial in plain text or over TCP/IP
		A synchronous/asynchronous protocol (depends on the message type)

		Frame Contents (in order):
			-Name-				-Size-
			Frame Start			1 byte			
			Message Type		4 bits
			Operation Code		4 bits
			Payload Size		1 byte
			Payload				n bytes
			Frame End			1 byte

		Frame Start
			0xBD

		Message Type
			Determines what kind of message the transmission is
			Response 0x0
				No response to frame
				The operation code must be the same as the command this is in response to
				Payload is the result (0x00 = success, 0xFF = invalid payload, anything else is the error code)

			Command 0x1
				A response is needed
				The payload is the command parameters

			Query 0x2
				A response is needed
				The payload is empty

			Broadcast 0xF
				No response to frame
				The payload is the new state

		Operation Code
			Locked state 0x0
				Can be set or queried (payload is 1 byte, 0x00 = unlocked, 0x01 = locked)
				If command is sent while door is locked, 0x01 is returned

			Privacy state 0x1
				Can be set or queried (payload is 1 byte, 0x00 = public, 0x01 = private)
				If command is sent, 0x11 is returned

			1-Wire Bus state 0x2
				Can be set or queried (payload is 1 byte, 0x00 = disabled, 0x01 = enabled)

			Failed Logins 0x3
				Can only be queried (payload is empty)
				Get a list of the failed logins (list of comma seperated values)

			Invalid Login 0xF
				Can only be broadcasted (payload is the 8 byte ibutton id)
				A command or query will return 0xFF

		Payload Size
			Size of the payload (in bytes)

		Payload
			Variable length (0-255 bytes)

		Frame End
			0xDB


		-Examples-
			Unlock door (if in public mode)
				send: 		0xBD 0x10 0x00 0xDB
				receive:	0xBD 0x00 0x00 0xDB

			Query 1-Wire Bus state
				send:		0xBD 0x22 0xDB
				receive:	0xBD 0x02 0x0? 0xDB
